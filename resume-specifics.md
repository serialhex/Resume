---------------------------------------------------------------

## Programming Experience (paid & personal projects)
* Ruby
    * Worked on a project to transform a (decently large) XML file full of customer data into a number of HTML files so the data could easily be viewed & input into new system.  The client did not want to spend the money it would cost to transform the data into something their new CMS could understand.
    * Most of the programs I did for my first-year programming course I did in C++ and Ruby, just to show some of the people in my class how much smaller a program can be in another language ('Hello World' being a one-liner with no magic *fluff* surrounding it)
* C++
    * Added Gaussian random number generators to the Shogun machine learning toolbox [http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/).
* Clojure
    * Writing an in-house app to handle all of the various things a small computer store needs, such as customers, work orders, special orders, and technicians.  The billing is taken care of by Quickbooks, so it will have to eventually connect to that in order to create invoices, keep customer information in sync, and the like.
* Haskell
    * Created a dice probability program, mainly to understand the (exact) probability of rolling a 12 on 2d4 + 3d6.  That project is still not complete and is an active interest of mine.
    * My website (serialhex.net) uses Hakyll as the static site generator, enabling me to write up posts, and push them to the web quickly (and cheaply, static sites are much nicer on bandwidth & computation!)
* C#
    * Developed an in-house program that got names, phone numbers and addresses for a contest during the Windows 8 launch.  The program was developed using Visual Studio 2012 and is a Windows 8 native app.  I also used C# to later draw the winner,
* PHP
    * Used as part of a survey on my company's website.  Also developed a bot-checker so we wouldn't get so much spam from it.

## General Computer Technician Experience
* 5+ years professional computer repair work includes, but is not limited to tasks like...
    * Virus & malware removal.  Especially sticky ones, that most virus scanners will not find or remove, and annoying ones that most virus scanners think are okay.
    * Data recovery from drives that simply do not want to share its data with anyone or anything.  Most of the time it is possible to recover most of the data - as long as the drive still spins anyway.
    * Installing printers, and other computer peripherals.  Also troubleshooting when those peripherals stop working for one reason or another.
    * Wired & wireless networking.  Not only helping to plan a network, but setting it up & troubleshooting it when things go wrong (as they eventually do).  Figuring out why computer X can't get online when the rest can, or when only computer X can get online and everyone else is stuck.
    * Recommending upgrades for computers, whether it be for that computer or to a new computer (and setting up said new computer afterwards as the client likes it).
