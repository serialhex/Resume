### Programming Experience (paid & own projects)
* Ruby
    * Worked on a project to transform a (decently large) XML file full of customer data into a number of HTML files so the data could easily be viewed & input into new system.  The client did not want to spend the money it would cost to transform the data into something their new CMS could understand.
    * Most of the programs I did for my first-year programming course I did in C++ and Ruby, just to show some of the people in my class how much smaller a program can be in another language ('Hello World' being a one-liner with no magic *fluff* surrounding it)
* Haskell
    * Created a dice probability program, mainly to understand the probabilities of rolling a 12 on 2d4 + 3d6.  That project is still not complete and is an active interest of mine.
    * My website (serialhex.net) uses Hakyll as the static site generator, enabling me to write up posts, and push them to the web quickly (and cheaply, static sites are much nicer on bandwidth & computation!)
* C++
    * Added Gaussian random number generators to the Shogun machine learning toolbox [http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/](http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/).
* C#
    * Developed an in-house program that got names, phone numbers and addresses for a contest during the Windows 8 launch.  The program was developed using Visual Studio 2012 and is a Windows 8 native app.  I also used C# to later draw the winner,
* PHP
    * Used as part of a survey on my company's website.  Also developed a bot-checker so we wouldn't get so much spam from it.
