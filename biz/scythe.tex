To Whom it may concern.

\smallskip

I found this listing, and it sounds very interesting.
The idea of designing robots to do menial tasks, like mow lawns, is awesome.
I know it's not a ground-breaking innovation - people have been using machines for millennium - but it is refreshing that technology \& A.I. is being used to make people's lives easier, not harder.

\smallskip

While it may not be readily apparent, I do have some experience working outdoors.
For a few months between jobs I worked at Big Little Guy pressure washing in the hose management department (I ran the hose around, making sure it wasn't kinked so the jobs could get done effectively).

\smallskip

As a homeowner, I have been practically forced to acquaint myself with various power tools.
Doing so has enabled me to fix a number of issues around the house, including fixing my mailbox.
At one point I assisted a friend building a custom projector mount that hung from the railing of a staircase.
I have also built a simple computer desk for myself.

\smallskip

And, of course, I do my own lawn work.

\smallskip

Working in software development I am familiar with needing detail and have worked with other engineers in solving problems.
When working at Level 3 Inspection I worked with mechanical engineers to ensure the data collected and processed was exactly what they needed.
Problem solving is something I enjoy, especially in a team setting where we can divide up the problems to solve them quicker, or troubleshoot together for particularly challenging problems.

\smallskip

Thank you for your consideration, and have an awesome day!
